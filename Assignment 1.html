        style="text-align: justify;">
        Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire. A tutor's role is not merely to impart
        knowledge but to ignite a passion for learning within each student. By fostering curiosity, encouraging critical
        thinking, and providing personalized support, tutors help students to not only absorb information but to
        understand, apply, and innovate. Through dedicated guidance and inspiration, tutoring transforms potential into
        achievement and challenges into opportunities.‚Äù</blockquote>

    <h4>Learn about Html Formating Tags</h4>
    <p>In our HTML course, we teach students how to format their web pages using various tags. For instance, the
        b-tag is used for bold text, which helps in highlighting keywords. The strong-tag is used for important
        text, giving it more semantic weight. To italicize text, we use the i-tag, and for emphasis, the em-tag. To
        highlight specific parts of the text, the mark-tag can be used. If you need to display text in a smaller
        font, the small-tag helps To indicate deleted content, the del-tag is
        used, while the ins-tag shows inserted
        text. For chemical formulas or mathematical notations, sub-tag is
        used, and sup-tag is used for to display superscript text
        By mastering these tags, students can create well-structured and
        visually appealing web content. Th examples of tag effects are shown below</p>
